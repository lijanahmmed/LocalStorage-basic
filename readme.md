# LocalStorage

LocalStorage is a web storage feature that allows websites to store data in a user's browser with no expiration time. It saves data as key-value pairs in a simple and lightweight way, accessible through JavaScript. Since it persists even after the browser is closed, itâ€™s ideal for saving user preferences, settings, or session data.
